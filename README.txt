A fully interactive Filipino language lesson plan converted into a web presentation. Designed with a Philippine-inspired aesthetic — gold sun rays, Baybayin background characters, and the red, blue, and gold flag palette. Includes 11 slides covering lesson objectives, vocabulary with flip cards, grammar breakdown, an annotated reading passage, a scored quiz in Filipino, homework guide, and a rubric. Built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
